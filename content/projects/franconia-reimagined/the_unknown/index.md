![A sculpture composed of two human figures and a large hollow wooden tube. The figures are facing away from the viewer, out across the wider sculpture park. In the distance are two unrelated sculptures, one of a series of taxidermied deer and one of a large round circular structure, and the varied treeline. The original photo has been modified to add a strange and slightly retro feel, adding light auras and rays of light shining down over the scene from the upper right corner of the photograph.](looking_out.jpg)
