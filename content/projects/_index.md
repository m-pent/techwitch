- Franconia Reimagined: Is an art project of mine and a way for me to share some of my love for this outdoor sculpture park.
- Enchancing Your Privacy: Is an ongoing project where I share my own journey in moving away from some of the bigger tech platforms, and my move toward more privacy-conscious choices when it comes to the technology we use every day.
