## Who we are

You are looking at the privacy policy for the website: https://techwitch.space.

This is a personal blog, run by an individual, not a corporation. Iâ€™m not interested in gathering your personal data and this website is not setup to collect any personal data. 

## Cookies

My blog is not setup to use any cookies or tracking technologies. 

However, pages and posts on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites has the potential to behave in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. 

Where possible I have configured this site to operate with privacy in mind, such as ensuring Google Analytics is disabled for the techwitch.space website, and preventing embedded services from utilising page data for personalised suggestions and ads. 

If you wish to further limit this type of external, third-party tracking, I would recommend the use of privacy preserving tools such as privacy and cookies/tracker blocking browser extensions to limit the amount of tracking and data available.

## Third Party Data Collection

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, as a part of the hosting provider's security measures, your IP will be logged and stored by GitHub, regardless of whether you are signed in with a GitHub account or not. I do not have control over GitHub's security measures but if you would like more information, please see [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
